## Hi everyone! üëã
My name is Katie Meier, and I am a sophomore math and computer science student at Boston University. Currently, I am a fellow in the Break Through Tech AI program, in which I have participated in a nine-week machine learning foundations course and career development seminars. Beginning in September, I will work with a team of fellows, industry mentors, and a challenge director on an ML project presented to us by a company partner.   
My main areas of interest at the moment are machine learning, neural networks, computational biology, computational neuroscience, and the intersection of computer science at law. I am strongly skilled in the areas of object-oriented programming, data structures, searching and sorting algorithms, and machine learning. I also have a strong background in single and multivariable calculus, statistics, probability, discrete math, and linear algebra.   
I am currently interested in obtaining a software engineering or ML internship for summer 2026 in which I can leverage my strong coding and mathematical backgrounds to 
collaborate with a motivated team of programmers, where I can help contribute to company goals and increase my own teamwork, programming, and professional skills.

## Tech Stack :wrench:   

-Programming Languages: Python, Java, C, Assembly  
-Librariers and Frameworks: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn  
-Development Tools: Jupyter Notebooks  

## Key Projects :bulb:

## Airbnb Price Predictor üè†
Executed the machine learning life cycle to create a model to predict the price of an AirBnb using the Random Forest algorithm, improving initial mean squared error by 62%. Utilized Pandas and scipy methods to clean data, used Grid Search to test for optimal model hyperparameters, and implemented seaborn methods to graph feature values vs. model performance

## Sudoku  
Implemented recursive backtracking in Java to efficiently solve sudokus. Created a custom Sudoku class including a two-dimensional list to reprsent the board, matrices to track if a column, row, or diagonal contained a certain number, and the key recursive backtracking algorithm that solved the puzzle. 

## MyArray   
Created a custom MyArray class like the Java array class. Contained multiple constructors, methods to take user input and create an array, a toString method, insert element, remove element, and grow array methods, and a compute statistics method that determined the sum, minimum value, maximum value, and average value of the array.

## Text Classifier :newspaper:  
In Python, built text models for New York Times lifestyle articles and New York Times U.S. news articles to determine which body of text a new, inputted article was more likely to have come from. Created a custom Text Model class to do so that created dictionaries for words, word lengths, word stems, sentence lengths, and punctuation. A similarity score was then computed between the new article and the two bodies of text using these five metrics.

## Extracurriculers and Hobbies

## Sponsorship Chair for Girls Who Code :computer:  
As part of this role, I have developed custom sponsorship packages for companies to advertise themselves, promote open positions, obtain our club member's resumes, and host sponsored events. I also work to plan general events for our club, such as machine learning workshops, research panels, and bonding events.

## Treasurer for the Association for Women in Math üìè  
As part of this role, I create detailed budget reports documenting our club's yearly expenses, and I create proposals to obtain funding for club events. 

## Running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
I have loved running since participating in high school cross country and track and field, and now I am a proud member of the run club at Boston University. In October of 2024, I ran the Boston Women's 10K, and I hope to run in the Cambridge Half-Marathon and the Newport Half-Marathon this year.
