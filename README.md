## Hi everyone! üëã
My name is Katie Meier, and I am a sophomore math and computer science student at Boston University. Currently, I am a fellow in the Break Through Tech AI program, in which I have participated in a nine-week machine learning foundations course and career development seminars. Additionally, I am a Project Fellow at MathWorks, where I am collaborating with 5 peers and a challenge advisor. We are using the Global Carbon Project's CO2 emissions dataset to employ time series forecasting to predit carbon emissions and inform strategies for achieving carbon neutrality by 2100.

My main areas of interest at the moment are machine learning, AI engineering, data analytics, and software engineering. I am strongly skilled in the areas of object-oriented programming, data structures, searching and sorting algorithms, and machine learning. I also have a strong background in single and multivariable calculus, statistics, probability, discrete math, and linear algebra.   
I am currently interested in obtaining a software engineering or ML internship for summer 2026 in which I can leverage my strong coding and mathematical backgrounds to 
collaborate with a motivated team of programmers, where I can help contribute to company goals and increase my own teamwork, programming, and professional skills.

## Tech Stack :wrench:   

-Programming Languages: Python, Java, C, Assembly, MATLAB
-Librariers and Frameworks: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Projects :bulb:

## Secret Voice-Unlock Journal üìì
Collaborated with 2 programmers to build a voice-activated, password-protected desktop notes app in 24 hours for a hackathon, employing Resemblyzer for audio features, Tkinter GUI for UI, and Figma for desig

## Airbnb Price Predictor üè†
Executed the machine learning life cycle to create a model to predict the price of an AirBnb using the Random Forest algorithm, decreasing initial mean squared error by 62%. Utilized Pandas and scipy methods to clean data, used Grid Search to test for optimal model hyperparameters, and implemented seaborn methods to graph feature values vs. model performance

## Sudoku  
Implemented recursive backtracking in Java to efficiently solve sudokus. Created a custom Sudoku class including a two-dimensional list to reprsent the board, matrices to track if a column, row, or diagonal contained a certain number, and the key recursive backtracking algorithm that solved the puzzle. 

## MyArray   
Created a custom MyArray class like the Java array class. Contained multiple constructors, methods to take user input and create an array, a toString method, insert element, remove element, and grow array methods, and a compute statistics method that determined the sum, minimum value, maximum value, and average value of the array.

## Text Classifier :newspaper:  
In Python, built text models for New York Times lifestyle articles and New York Times U.S. news articles to determine which body of text a new, inputted article was more likely to have come from. Created a custom Text Model class to do so that created dictionaries for words, word lengths, word stems, sentence lengths, and punctuation. A similarity score was then computed between the new article and the two bodies of text using these five metrics.

## Jobs and Extracurriculars
## Resident Assistant for Boston University Residence Life
I serve as a resident assisant for a building of 25 residents, working to build community and maintain a supportive environment for all. Aditionally, I serve biweekly on-call shifts for a residence neighbourhood of 2500 residents, utilizing problem solving skills to resolve students issues, enforcing university policies, and submitting detailed Incident Reports for any policy violations. 

## Sponsorship Chair for Girls Who Code :computer:  
As part of this role, I have developed custom sponsorship packages for companies to advertise themselves, promote open positions, obtain our club member's resumes, and host sponsored events. I also work to plan general events for our club, such as machine learning workshops, research panels, and bonding events.

## Treasurer for the Association for Women in Math üìè  
As part of this role, I create detailed budget reports documenting our club's yearly expenses, and I create proposals to obtain funding for club events. 

## Hobbies

## Running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
I have loved running since participating in high school cross country and track and field, and now I am a proud member of the run club at Boston University. In October of 2024, I ran the Boston Women's 10K, and I hope to run in the Cambridge Half-Marathon and the Newport Half-Marathon this year.
